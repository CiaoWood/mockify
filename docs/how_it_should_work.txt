0. A lot of Express apps.

  - a app to serve the Angular app (which is the mocKr interface) and to provide an API REST used for mocKr configuration.

    This app is the 'main' one and of course couldn't be stopped via the interface.

  - an app for each profixied API (1)

    The app is stopped / started each time a modification is made on it.
    The state of each app is displayed and can be configured in the Angular app.


1. Use case: no mocking, just proxy.

  All dev-apps query the Express apps (1) which proxy existing API(s).

  A 'record' feature allows to save parameters / responses into a database.


2. Alter the response of a specific query.

  It is possible to alter the response (code / body) of a query.

  This custom response can be saved in the DB instead of the 'real' one.


3. Saving an history of queries/responses.

  All is already saved in the DB. A internal mechanism export the DB rows to swagger definitions files.

  No tool seem exist so a specific generator should be developped for this task.


4. Mocking a complete API from the swagger definitions using an Express app.

  This tool seems be the solution: https://www.npmjs.org/package/swagger-jack
