Project Charter
===============

mocKr is a tool whose purpose is to proxy API(s) in order to provide a set
of informations/actions to make developpers life better.

As a developper:
  - I want to see in real time logs of all queries done on proxified API(s)
  - I want to historize the logs by API in order to:
    * copy parameters/response
    * replay a query
    * save an history for mocking
  - I want to enable/disable the recording of parameters/response by API
  - I want to add/edit/remove API(s)
  - I want to add/edit/remove a prefix in the URLs exposed by API
  - I want to wrap some queries (by url, parameters, REST method) and return
    a customized response or a customized error.
  - I want to have revisions of queries
  - I want to start mocKr just by a cli command with some params to
    mock an existing API.
